           I am a fullstack web developer with a 
           particular interest in Blockchain development in Solidity and Rust. 
           I have a passion for writing clean, readable and reusable code. 
           I try to keep up with the latest developments in Blockchain, 
           security and best practices, and am always looking for new things to learn.
